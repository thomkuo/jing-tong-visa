    "general": {
      "q1": "Does a U.S. citizen need a visa to visit China?",
      "a1": "Yes. U.S. citizens generally need a visa to visit China. If you are transiting through China, transit visa rules are managed separately by Chinese Entry & Exit authorities.",
      "q2": "How do I apply for a Chinese tourist visa?",
      "a2": "You can apply directly at the Chinese Consulate, or work with a visa service like Jing Tong. We handle the entire process — from application preparation to Embassy submission — so you don't need to visit the Consulate yourself.",
      "q3": "Do I need an appointment to submit my application?",
      "a3": "The Chinese Embassy Visa Section no longer requires appointments for walk-in submissions. If you plan to drop off your application at our office, please contact us in advance to schedule a time so we can best assist you.",
      "q4": "Is the Chinese Embassy/Consulate currently open?",
      "a4": "Yes, the Chinese Embassy and Consulate Visa Sections are currently open to the public for walk-in submissions.",
      "q5": "Can I mail my application directly to the Chinese Embassy?",
      "a5": "No. The Chinese Embassy does not accept mailed applications. All applications must be submitted in person or through an authorized agent."
    },
    "documents": {
      "q1": "What documents do I need for a tourist visa?",
      "a1": "The core documents required are: (1) a valid passport, (2) proof of residency, and (3) a recent visa photo. Depending on your background, additional documents may be needed. See our full Document Checklist for details.",
      "q2": "Do I need a flight ticket or hotel booking to apply?",
      "a2": "No. Flight confirmations and hotel reservations are not required for a standard tourist visa application. However, if you have travel booked within the next two weeks, including a flight itinerary can help expedite your case.",
      "q3": "Do I need an invitation letter?",
      "a3": "No. An invitation letter is not required for a Chinese tourist visa.",
      "q4": "What photo requirements apply to my visa application?",
      "a4": "Your photo must have been taken within the last 6 months and must meet Chinese visa photo specifications. We provide a photo guide to help ensure your photo is accepted.",
      "q5": "I renewed my passport but my old visa is still valid. What do I do?",
      "a5": "If your new and old passports contain identical information (name, date of birth, gender), you can travel to China using both passports together. Make sure your travel purpose matches the visa type. If not, you will need to apply for a new visa."
    },
    "fees-timeline": {
      "q1": "How much does a Chinese tourist visa cost?",
      "a1": "The Chinese Embassy fee for U.S. citizens is $140 per person for standard processing, or $165 for expedited processing. Jing Tong's service fee is separate — please contact us for a quote based on your specific situation.",
      "q2": "How long does it take to get my visa?",
      "a2": "Under normal circumstances, the full process takes approximately 2–3 weeks for standard processing. This includes application preparation, Embassy pre-approval review, and visa issuance. During peak season (typically 2–3 months after Chinese New Year), processing may extend to 3–6 weeks. We recommend applying at least 2–3 months before your travel date.",
      "q3": "What is the difference between standard and expedited processing?",
      "a3": "Standard processing takes approximately 2–3 weeks end-to-end. Expedited processing prioritizes your submission and can reduce Embassy processing to 2–3 business days, though the overall timeline still depends on shipping and review stages.",
      "q4": "How does the new COVA online system affect my application?",
      "a4": "Under the current system, all applications must first be submitted online through the Chinese Online Visa Application (COVA) system for a preliminary review. Only after pre-approval can the physical passport be submitted to the Embassy. If an application is not pre-approved on the first attempt, it returns to the review queue, which can add delays. Our team's experience means most applications are pre-approved on the first submission."
    },
    "after-submission": {
      "q1": "How will I receive my visa?",
      "a1": "Once your visa is issued, we ship your passport — now containing the visa sticker — back to you via FedEx with tracking, signature confirmation, and insurance. You'll receive a tracking number by email on the day it ships.",
      "q2": "Is it safe to mail my passport?",
      "a2": "We recommend FedEx or UPS for shipping important documents. All packages are securely packed, tracked, require signature confirmation, and are insured up to $500. This method has a strong track record of safe delivery.",
      "q3": "What if my application is delayed or denied?",
      "a3": "Processing times can vary based on Embassy workload and season. The Embassy does not set a fixed decision date — we will notify you as soon as a decision is made. If additional documents are requested, we will guide you through the next steps promptly.",
      "q4": "Do I need to attend an interview or provide biometrics?",
      "a4": "For applicants without complex or sensitive backgrounds, interviews and biometric collection are generally not required."
