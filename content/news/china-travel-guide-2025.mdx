China is one of the world's most rewarding travel destinations — ancient history, stunning landscapes, vibrant cities, and a culture unlike anywhere else on earth. But planning a trip to China requires more preparation than most destinations. Here's a practical guide to help you make the most of your first visit.

## Step 1: Get Your Visa Sorted First

Before booking flights or hotels, **secure your China tourist visa**. The visa process typically takes 2–3 weeks from start to finish, and you need a valid visa before you can enter the country.

Key points:
- U.S. citizens need a tourist (L) visa to enter mainland China
- Apply at least 2–3 months before your travel date
- Work with a visa agency or apply directly at the Chinese Embassy in your jurisdiction

Once your visa is approved, you'll have clarity on your travel dates and can book everything else with confidence.

## Step 2: Choose Your Destinations

China is vast — nearly the size of the United States — so it helps to focus your first trip rather than trying to see everything. Here are some of the most rewarding first-timer itineraries:

### The Classic Northern Route (7–10 days)
**Beijing → Xi'an → Shanghai**

- **Beijing:** The Great Wall, Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Hutong neighborhoods
- **Xi'an:** The Terracotta Warriors, Ancient City Wall, Muslim Quarter
- **Shanghai:** The Bund, French Concession, Yuyuan Garden, world-class food scene

This itinerary covers 3,000 years of history and is well-served by high-speed rail (Beijing–Xi'an: ~5 hours; Xi'an–Shanghai: ~6 hours).

### Southern China (7–10 days)
**Hong Kong → Guilin → Chengdu**

- **Hong Kong:** (Technically a Special Administrative Region — no mainland visa required for most visitors)
- **Guilin & Yangshuo:** The iconic karst mountains and Li River
- **Chengdu:** Giant pandas, Sichuan cuisine, relaxed teahouse culture

### The Yangtze Triangle (5–7 days)
**Shanghai → Suzhou → Hangzhou**

Perfect for visitors who want depth over breadth — classical gardens, silk culture, and West Lake.

## Step 3: Book Your Flights

Major U.S. gateways with direct service to China include:
- **New York (JFK)** → Beijing, Shanghai
- **Los Angeles (LAX)** → Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen
- **San Francisco (SFO)** → Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu

Flight times range from 13–16 hours depending on the route. **Book early** — flights to China can fill up, especially during Chinese holidays and peak summer season (June–August).

## Step 4: Plan for Connectivity

Internet access in China is managed differently than in the U.S. Many services you rely on — Google, Gmail, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook — are blocked in mainland China. To stay connected, you have two options:

1. **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Download and activate before you arrive. Set this up before you land — it's much harder to do from inside China.
2. **China SIM or roaming plan:** Your carrier may offer China roaming plans; alternatively, a local data SIM purchased at the airport is affordable and fast.

Apps that work without a VPN in China: WeChat (essential), Baidu Maps, Didi (ride-hailing), Alipay (mobile payments).

## Step 5: Currency and Payments

China has moved aggressively toward mobile payments. **Alipay** and **WeChat Pay** handle the vast majority of transactions — from street food to taxi rides to convenience stores.

Setting up Alipay or WeChat Pay as a foreign visitor now requires linking an international credit card. This was not possible for many years but is now supported for most major U.S. cards (Visa and Mastercard).

**Keep some cash (RMB/Yuan) on hand** for smaller vendors, rural areas, and situations where apps aren't accepted. ATMs at major banks (ICBC, Bank of China, China Construction Bank) reliably accept international cards.

## Step 6: Health and Safety

China is generally a safe destination for travelers. A few practical notes:

- **Travel insurance:** Highly recommended, with medical evacuation coverage
- **Air quality:** Can vary significantly by city and season — Beijing in winter can have poor air quality; check an app like AQI China before heading out
- **Food safety:** Stick to busy, well-reviewed restaurants; avoid uncooked street food if you have a sensitive stomach
- **Tap water:** Do not drink tap water — bottled water is widely available and inexpensive
